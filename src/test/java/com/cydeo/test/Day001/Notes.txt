Maven project:
----------------------------------
- "build" automation tool
- "build" -> refers to repeating steps when creating an obj
- Maven project itself is diff than java proj
- Maven is not a tool for testers, mainly for tool for devs, we use it for dependency
             organization and folder str

SRC folder
----------------------------------
> main: where devs will write their code
> test: this is where the devs will write their unit tests
        -> we write our tests here as well
> pom.xml: used to add and manage the dependencies of the project
> target: where maven is storing the compiled version of the project and other info
                -> used for storing HTML reports
                -> only appears after you run your code
                -> consistently refreshed when code is run

Selenium methods:
----------------------------------
#1. What does it do?
#2. Does it accept any args?
#3. Does it have any return type?
#4. Does it throw and certain type of exception?

>>> get("");
    -> #1. Gets the given URL in opened browser
    -> #2. Accepts a String arg
    -> #3. void; no return type

>>>.getTitle() ;
    #1. Gets the title of the page
    #2. none
    #3.returns String; title of the page

>>> .getCurrentUrl();
     #1. Gets the URL of the current page
     #2. none
     #3.returns String; url of the current page

>>> driver.manage().window().maximize();
       #1. Expands the current page to max size
       #2. none
       #3. void; no return type

>>> Why is it critical to maximize the page?
    -> in different sizes, the content will display differently due to reactive frameworks
    -> happens when the page is "responsive"
        -> if size gets smaller, it will display less content
        ->may trigger a hamburger menu

>>>driver.close();
   -> will close only the currently opened session
   -> if we have more than one window open, it will only close the one that it is focused on

>>>driver.quit();
    -> it will kill the current session
    -> means if we have more than one open window/page, it will close all of them
    -> after using driver.quit(), we can NOT execute any lines after this
    -> will throw a "NoSuchSessionException"

> What is a session?



Basic Navigations:
----------------------------------
    driver.navigate() --> allows us to do simple navigations'
    driver.navigate().foreword() --> will take page to the next page
    driver.navigate().back() --> will take page to previous page
    driver.navigate().refresh() --> will refresh the current page
    driver.navigate(),to() --> exactly the same as .get("URL") method
